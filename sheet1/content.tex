The interspike intervals are shown in figure 1 for a frequency of 100Hz and a trial of 10s.

The coefficient of variance $C_V = \frac{\sigma_{isi}^2}{E[\tau]}$ was $1.018ms$ and the fano factor $F = \frac{\sigma_n^2}{E[n]}$:

A neural tuning curve shows the correlation between a given stimulus, like the orientation of a bar of light, and the firing rate of the neuron.
It can give one insight into the property of brain cells to represent a particular type of information, such as if the bar of light is tilted.
